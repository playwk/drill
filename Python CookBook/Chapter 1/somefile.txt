Given all of this, together with GitHub, we see three clear opportunities ahead.
First, we will empower developers at every stage of the development lifecycle –
from ideation to collaboration to deployment to the cloud. Going forward, GitHub
will remain an open platform, which any developer can plug into and extend.
Developers will continue to be able to use the programming languages,
tools and operating systems of their choice for their projects –
and will still be able to deploy their code on any cloud and any device.
Second, we will accelerate enterprise developers’ use of GitHub,
with our direct sales and partner channels and access to Microsoft’s global cloud infrastructure and services.
Finally, we will bring Microsoft’s developer tools and services to new audiences.
Most importantly, we recognize the responsibility we take on with this agreement.
I love python.
We are committed to being stewards of the GitHub community,
which will retain its developer-first ethos,
operate independently and remain an open platform.
We will always listen to developer feedback and invest in both fundamentals and new capabilities.
Once the acquisition closes later this year,
GitHub will be led by CEO Nat Friedman, an open source veteran and founder of Xamarin,
who will continue to report to Microsoft Cloud + AI Group Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie;
GitHub CEO and Co-Founder Chris Wanstrath will be a technical fellow at Microsoft, also reporting to Scott.
You can see how Chris, Nat and I envision the opportunity ahead in this public presentation.
Together we will continue to advance GitHub as a platform loved by developers and trusted by organizations.
